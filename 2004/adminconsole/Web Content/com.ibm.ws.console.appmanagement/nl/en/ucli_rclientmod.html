<h2>Application client assembly settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to specify assembly properties for J2EE application
clients.</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="file_name"></a>File name (Required, String)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the file name of the application client module, relative
to the top level of the Enterprise Archive (EAR) file.
<p>If this is a stand-alone module, the file name is the full path name of
the archive.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="alternative_DD"></a>Alternative DD</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the file name for an alternative deployment descriptor
file to use instead of the original deployment descriptor file in the module
Java Archive (JAR) file. Although you can edit deployment descriptor
files, do not use the administrative console to modify them.
<p>This file is the post-assembly version of the deployment descriptor file.
(Manually edit the original deployment descriptor file to resolve dependencies
and security information. Directing the use of the alternative deployment
descriptor allows you to keep the original deployment descriptor file intact).
The value of the Alternative DD property must be the full path name of the
deployment descriptor file relative to the module root directory. By convention,
the file is in the <samp>ALT-INF</samp> directory. If this property is not specified,
the deployment descriptor file is read directly from the module JAR file.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="classpath"></a>Classpath</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the full classpath containing the dependent code that
is not contained in the application client JAR file. 
<p>Specify the values relative to the root of the EAR file and separate the
values with spaces. Absolute values that reference files or directories on
the hard drive are ignored. To specify classes that are not in JAR files but
are in the root of the EAR file, use a period and forward slash (./). Consider
the following example directory structure in which the file myapp.ear contains
an application client JAR file named <samp>client.jar</samp>. Additional classes
reside in <samp>class1.jar</samp> and <samp>class2.zip</samp> files. A class named
xyz.class is not packaged in a JAR file but is in the root of the EAR file <samp>myapp.ear/client.jar
myapp.ear/class1.jar myapp.ear/class2.zip myapp.ear/xyz.class</samp>.  Specify
class1.jar class2.zip ./ as the value of the Classpath property. (Name only
the directory for <samp>.class</samp> files.)</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="display_name"></a>Display name (Required, String)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a short name that is intended for display by GUIs.
<p></p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="small_icon"></a>Small icon</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a JPEG or GIF file containing a small image (16x16 pixels).
<p>The image is used as an icon to represent the application client in a GUI.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="large_icon"></a>Large icon</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a JPEG or GIF file containing a large image (32x32 pixels). 
<p>The image is used as an icon to represent the application client in a GUI</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="description"></a>Description</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Contains text describing the application client.
<p></p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="main_class"></a>Main class (Required, String)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the full path name of the main class for this application
client.
<p></p>
