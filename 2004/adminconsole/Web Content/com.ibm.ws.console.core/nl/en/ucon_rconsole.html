<h2>Administrative console areas</h2>

<p>Use the administrative console to create and manage resources,
 applications and servers or to view product messages.</p>

<p>To view the administrative console, ensure that the application  server
for the administrative console is running. Point a Web browser at  the URL
for the administrative console, enter your user ID and, if needed, a  password
on a Login page.</p>

<p>The console has the following main areas, which you can resize as desired:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="menu"></a>Taskbar</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The taskbar offers options for returning to the console Home page,
saving  changes to administrative configurations, specifying console-wide
preferences,  logging out of the console, and accessing product information.

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="tree"></a>Navigation tree</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The navigation tree on the left side of the console offers links
to  console pages that you use to create and manage components in a WebSphere Application Server 
administrative cell.
<p>Click on a <strong>+</strong> beside a tree folder or item to expand the tree for
the folder  or item. Click on a <strong>-</strong> to collapse the tree for the folder
or item.  Double-click on an item in the tree view to toggle its state between
expanded  and collapsed.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="workspace"></a>WorkSpace</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The workspace on the right side of the console contains pages that
you   use to create and manage configuration objects such as servers and resources.
 Click links in the navigation tree to view the different types of configured
 objects. Within the workspace, click on configured objects to view their
 configurations, run-time status, and options. Click <strong>Home</strong> in the taskbar
 to display the workspace Home page, which contains links to information on
using  the WebSphere Application Server product.

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="status"></a>WebSphere Status</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The status messages area at the bottom of the console provides
 information on messages returned by the WebSphere Application Server  as to problems in your
administrative configuration as well as messages  about run-time events. Click <strong>Previous</strong> or <strong>Next</strong> to
toggle among  displays of configuration problems and run-time events.
<p>You can adjust the interval between automatic refreshes in the Preferences
 settings.</p>
