<h2>Login settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to specify the user for the WebSphere Application Server  administrative
console. If you are using global security, then you also specify a  password.</p>

<p>Specifying a user allows you to resume work done previously  with the product.
After you type in a user ID, click <strong>OK</strong> to  proceed to the next page
and access the administrative console.</p>

<p>To view this page, start the administrative console.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="logon_desc"></a>User ID</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a string identifying the user. The user ID must  be unique
to the administrative server.
<p>Work that you do with the product and then save before exiting the product
 will be saved to a configuration identified by the user ID that you enter.
 To later access work done under that user ID, specify the user ID in  the
Login page.</p>

<p>If you are logging in from a client machine that currently has a browser
 open on the administrative console and you connect to the same server, your
two  connections might share the same HTTP session object, whether or not
 you are logging in under different user IDs. You must use two different types
 of browsers (for example, Microsoft Internet Explorer and Netscape Communicator)
 to log in to the administrative console from the same client machine in order
to  work from two different HTTP session objects, whether or not you use the
same  user ID. That is, if you need two concurrent sessions on the same client
machine,  access the administrative console from two different browser types.</p>

<p>Note that you can use the same browser type to log in twice to the console,
 but you must log in from different physical hosts and use different user
IDs.  For example, suppose that Joe logs into the administrative console under
the  user ID <em>joe</em> on the physical host <em>myhost1</em> using an Internet
 Explorer browser. Joe can log into the same console a second time using an
 Internet Explorer browser, but he must use a different user ID (such as <em>peggy</em>)
 and a different physical host (such as <em>myhost2</em>).</p>

<dd>Specifies whether to log out the user and continue work with the
user ID   specified or to return to the Login page and specify a different
user ID or wait  for the user to log out.
<p>This field appears if the user closed a Web browser while browsing the
administrative  console and did not first log out, then opened a new browser
and tried accessing the  administrative console.</p>

 configuration and not use the configuration last used for the user's session.
 Changes made to the user's session since the last saving of the administrative
 configuration will be lost.
<p>This field appears only if the user changed the administrative configuration
 and then logged out without saving the changes.</p>
