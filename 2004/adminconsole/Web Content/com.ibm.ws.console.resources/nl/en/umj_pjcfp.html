<h2>Generic JMS connection factory settings</h2>

<p>Use this panel to view or change the configuration properties of
the selected JMS connection factory for use with the associated JMS provider.
These configuration properties control how connections are created to the
associated JMS destination.</p>

<p>A JMS connection factory is used to create connections to JMS destinations.
The JMS connection factory is created by the associated JMS provider. A JMS
connection factory for a generic JMS provider (other than the embedded WebSphere
JMS provider or the WebSphere MQ JMS provider) has the following properties:</p>

<p>To view this administrative console page, click <strong>Resources-&gt; Generic
JMS Providers-&gt; <em>provider_name</em>-&gt; JMS Connection Factories-&gt; <em>connection_factory</em></strong>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="GenericJMSConnectionFactory_Name"></a>Name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The name by which this JMS connection factory is known for administrative
purposes within IBM WebSphere Application Server. The name must be unique
within the associated JMS provider.

<strong><a name="GenericJMSConnectionFactory_type"></a>Type</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Whether this connection factory is for creating JMS queue destinations
or JMS topic destinations.
<p>Select one of the following options:<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Queue</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A JMS queue connection factory for point-to-point messaging.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Topic</strong>
</dt>
<dd>A JMS topic connection factory for publish/subscribe messaging.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="GenericJMSConnectionFactory_externaljndiName"></a>JNDI name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The JNDI name that is used to bind the connection factory into
the application server's name space.
<p>As a convention, use the fully qualified JNDI name; for example, in the
form jms/<em>Name</em>, where <em>Name</em>  is
the logical name of the resource.</p>

<p>This name is used to link the platform binding information. The binding
associates the resources defined by the deployment descriptor of the module
to the actual (physical) resources bound into JNDI by the platform.</p>

<strong><a name="AuthDataAlias"></a>Component-managed Authentication Alias</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This alias specifies a user ID and password to be used to authenticate
connection to a JMS provider for application-managed authentication.
<p>This property provides a list of the J2C authentication data entry aliases
that have been defined to WebSphere Application Server. You can select a data
entry alias to be used to authenticate the creation of a new connection to
the JMS provider.</p>

<p>If you have enabled global security for WebSphere Application Server, select
the alias that specifies the user ID and password used to authenticate the
creation of a new connection to the JMS provider. The use of this alias depends
on the resource authentication (res-auth) setting declared in the connection
factory resource reference of an application  component's deployment descriptors.</p>

<p>
<b>Note: </b>User IDs longer than 12 characters cannot be used for authentication
with the embedded WebSphere JMS provider. For example, the default Windows
NT user ID, <strong>Administrator</strong>, is not valid for use with embedded WebSphere
messaging, because it contains 13 characters. Therefore, an authentication
alias for a WebSphere JMS provider connection factory must specify a user
ID no longer than 12 characters.</p>

</dd>

<strong><a name="mappingAuthDataAlias"></a>Container-managed Authentication Alias</strong>

<strong><a name="ConnectionFactory_connectionPool"></a>Connection pool</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies an optional set of connection pool settings. 
<p>Connection pool properties are common to all J2C connectors. </p>

<p>The application server pools connections and sessions with the JMS provider
to improve performance. This is independent from any WebSphere MQ connection
pooling. You need to configure the connection and session pool properties
appropriately for your applications, otherwise you may not get the connection
and session behavior that you want.</p>

<p>Change the size of the connection pool if concurrent server-side access
to the JMS resource exceeds the default value.The size of the connection pool
is set on a per queue or topic basis. See the following table for details.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="ConnectionFactory_sessionPool"></a>Session pool</strong>

<dt>
<strong><a name="GenericJMSConnectionFactory_contextId"></a>Scope</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the level to which this resource definition is visible
-- the cell, node, or server level.
<p>Resources such as JMS Providers, Namespace bindings, or shared libraries
can be defined at multiple scopes, with resources defined at more specific
scopes overriding duplicates which are defined at more general scopes.</p>

<p>Note that no matter what the scope of a defined resource, the resource's
properties only apply at an individual server level. For example, if you define
the scope of a data source at the Cell level, all users in that Cell can look
up and use that data source, which is unique within that Cell. However, resource
property settings are local to each server in the Cell. For example, if you
set <strong>Max Connections</strong> to 10, then each server in that Cell can have 10
connections.<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Cell</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The most general scope.  Resources defined at the Cell scope are visible
from all Nodes and servers, unless they are overridden. To view resources
defined in the cell scope, do not specify a server or a node name in the scope
selection form.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Node</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The default scope for most resource types.  Resources defined at the Node
scope override any duplicates defined at the Cell scope and are visible to
all servers on the same node, unless they  are overridden at a server scope
on that node. To view resources defined in a node scope, do not specify a
server, but select a node name in the scope selection form.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Server</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The most specific scope for defining resources.  Resources defined at
the Server scope override any duplicate resource definitions defined at the
Cell scope or parent Node scope and are visible only to  a specific server.
To view resources defined in a server scope, specify a server name as well
as a node name in the scope selection form.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>When resources are created, they are always created into the current scope
selected in the panel.   To view resources in other scopes, specify a different
node or server in the scope selection form.  </p>
