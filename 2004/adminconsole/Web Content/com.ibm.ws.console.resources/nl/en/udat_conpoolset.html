<h2>Connection pool settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to configure connection pool settings.</p>

<p>This administrative console page is common to a range of
resource types; for example, JDBC data sources and JMS queue connection factories.
To view this page, the path depends on the type of resource, but generally
you select an instance of the resource provider, then an instance of the resource
type, then click <strong>Connection Pool</strong>. For example: click <strong>Resources</strong> &gt; <strong>JDBC
Providers</strong> &gt; <strong>JDBC_provider</strong> &gt; <strong>Data Sources</strong> &gt; <strong>data_source</strong> &gt; <strong>Connection
Pool</strong>.</p>

<div>
<p>
<strong>Configuration tab</strong>
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="Connectionpool_detail_contextID"></a>Scope</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the level to which this resource definition is visible
-- the cell, node, or server level.
<p>Resources such as JDBC Providers, Namespace bindings, or shared libraries
can be defined at multiple scopes, with resources defined at more specific
scopes overriding duplicates which are defined at more general scopes.</p>

<p>Note that no matter what the scope of a defined resource, the resource's
properties only apply at an individual server level. For example, if you define
the scope of a data source at the Cell level, all users in that Cell can look
up and use that data source, which is unique within that Cell. However, resource
property settings are local to each server in the Cell. For example, if you
define <em>max connections</em> to 10, then each server in that Cell can have
10 connections.<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Cell</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The most general scope.  Resources defined at the Cell scope are visible
from all Nodes and  servers, unless they are overridden. To view resources
defined in the cell scope, do not specify a server or a node name in the scope
selection  form.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Node</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The default scope for most resource types.  Resources defined at the Node
scope override  any duplicates defined at the Cell scope and are visible to
all servers on the same node, unless they  are overridden at a server scope
on that node. To view resources defined in a node scope, do not specify a
server, but select a node name in the scope  selection form.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Server</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The most specific scope for defining resources.  Resources defined at
the Server scope override  any duplicate resource definitions defined at the
Cell scope or parent Node scope and are visible only to  a specific server.
To view resources defined in a server scope, specify a server name as well
as a node name in the scope  selection form.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>When resources are created, they are always created into the current scope
selected in the panel.   To view resources in other scopes, specify a different
node or server in the scope selection form.  </p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="ConnectionPool_connectionTimeout_displayName"></a>Connection Timeout </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the interval, in seconds, after which a connection request
times out and a ConnectionWaitTimeoutException is thrown.
<p> The wait is necessary when the maximum value of connections (<em>Max Connections</em>)
to a particular connection pool is reached .  For example, if <em>Connection
Timeout</em> is set to 300 and the maximum number of connections is reached,
the Pool Manager waits for 300 seconds for an available physical connection.
If a physical connection is <em>not</em> available within this time, the Pool
Manager throws a ConnectionWaitTimeoutException.  It usually does not make
sense to retry the <em>getConnection()</em> method, because if a longer wait
time is required, you should set the <em>Connection Timeout</em> setting to
a higher value. Therefore, if this exception is caught by the application,
the administrator should review the expected usage of the application and
tune the connection pool and the database accordingly.</p>

<p>If Connection Timeout is set to 0, the Pool Manager waits as long as necessary
until a connection is allocated (which happens when the number of connections
falls below the value of <em>Max Connections</em>). </p>

<p>If Max Connections is set to 0, which enables an infinite number of physical
connections, then the Connection Timeout value is ignored.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="ConnectionPool_maxConnections_displayName"></a>Max Connections </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum number of physical connections that you can
create in this pool. 
<p>These are the physical connections to the backend resource. Once this number
is reached, no new physical connections are created and the requester waits
until a physical connection that is currently in use returns to the pool,
or a ConnectionWaitTimeoutException is thrown. </p>

<p>For example, if the Max Connections value is set to 5, and there are five
physical connections in use, the pool manager waits for the amount of time
specified in Connection Timeout for a physical connection to become free. </p>

<p>If Max Connections is set to 0, the Connection Timeout value is ignored.
 </p>

<p>For better performance, set the value for the connection pool lower than
the value for the Max Connections option in the Web container. Lower settings,
such as 10-30 connections, perform better than higher settings, such as 100. </p>

<p>If clones are used, one data pool exists for each clone. Knowing the number
of data pools is important when configuring the database maximum connections.</p>

<p>You can use the Tivoli Performance Viewer
to find the optimal number of connections in a pool. If the number of concurrent
waiters is greater than 0, but the CPU load is not close to 100%, consider
increasing the connection pool size. If the Percent Used value is consistently
low under normal workload, consider decreasing the number of connections in
the pool.</p>

<strong><a name="ConnectionPool_minConnections_displayName"></a>Min Connections </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the minimum number of physical connections to maintain.
<p>Until this number is reached, the pool maintenance thread does not discard
physical connections. However, no attempt is made to bring the number of connections
up to this number.  If you set a value for Aged Timeout, the minimum is not
maintained. All connections with an expired age are discarded.</p>

<p>For example if the Min Connections value is set to 3, and one physical
connection is created, the Unused Timeout thread does not discard that connection.
By the same token, the thread does not automatically create two additional
physical connections to reach the Min Connections setting.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="ConnectionPool_reapTime_displayName"></a>Reap Time </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the interval, in seconds, between runs of the pool maintenance
thread.
<p> For example, if Reap Time is set to 60, the pool maintenance thread runs
every 60 seconds. The <em>Reap Time</em> interval affects the accuracy of the <em>Unused
Timeout</em> and <em>Aged Timeout</em> settings.  The smaller the interval, the
greater the accuracy. If the pool maintenance thread is enabled, set the Reap
Time value less than the values of Unused Timeout and Aged Timeout. When the
pool maintenance thread runs, it discards any connections remaining unused
for longer than the time value specified in Unused Timeout, until it reaches
the number of connections specified in <em>Min Connections</em>. The pool maintenance
thread also discards any connections that remain active longer than the time
value specified in Aged Timeout.</p>

<p> The Reap Time interval also affects performance.  Smaller intervals mean
that the pool maintenance thread runs more often and degrades performance.</p>

<p>To disable the pool maintenance thread set Reap Time to 0, or set both
Unused Timeout and Aged Timeout to 0. The recommended way to disable the pool
maintenance thread is to set Reap Time to 0, in which case Unused Timeout
and Aged Timeout are ignored. However, if Unused Timeout and Aged Timeout
are set to 0, the pool maintenance thread runs, but only physical connections
which timeout due to non-zero timeout values are discarded.</p>

<strong><a name="ConnectionPool_unusedTimeout_displayName"></a>Unused Timeout </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the interval in seconds after which an unused or idle
connection is discarded.
<p> Set the Unused Timeout value higher than the Reap Timeout value for optimal
performance.  Unused physical connections are only discarded if the current
number of connections not in use exceeds the Min Connections setting.  For
example, if the unused timeout value is set to 120, and the pool maintenance
thread is enabled (Reap Time is not 0), any physical connection that remains
unused for two minutes is discarded.  Note that accuracy of this timeout,
as well as performance, is affected by the Reap Time value.  See Reap Time
for more information.  </p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="ConnectionPool_agedTimeout_displayName"></a>Aged Timeout </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the interval in seconds before a physical connection
is discarded.
<p> Setting <em>Aged Timeout</em> to 0 supports active physical connections
remaining in the pool indefinitely. Set the Aged Timeout value higher than
the Reap Timeout value for optimal performance.  For example, if the Aged
Timeout value is set to 1200, and the Reap Time value is not 0, any physical
connection that remains in existence for 1200 seconds (20 minutes) is discarded
from the pool.   Note that accuracy of this timeout, as well as performance,
are affected by the Reap Time value.  See Reap Time for more information.

<strong><a name="ConnectionPool_purgePolicy_displayName"></a>Purge Policy </strong>

<dd>  Specifies how to purge connections when a <em>stale connection</em> or <em>fatal
connection error</em> is detected. 
<p>Valid values are <strong>EntirePool</strong> and <strong>FailingConnectionOnly</strong>. JCA
data sources can have either option. WebSphere Version 4.0 data sources always
have a purge policy of <strong>EntirePool</strong>.</p>

<strong>EntirePool</strong>
</dt>
<dd>All connections in the pool are marked stale. Any connection not in use
is immediately closed. A connection in use is closed and throws a <em>StaleConnectionException</em> during
the next operation on that connection. Subsequent <em>getConnection</em> requests
from the application result in new connections to the database opening. When
using this purge policy, there is a slight possibility that some connections
in the pool are closed unnecessarily when they are not stale. However, this
is a rare occurrence. In most cases, a purge policy of EntirePool is the best
choice.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>FailingConnectionOnly</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Only the connection that caused the <em>StaleConnectionException</em> is
closed. Although this setting eliminates the possibility that valid connections
are closed unnecessarily, it makes recovery from an application perspective
more complicated. Because only the currently failing connection is closed,
there is a good possibility that the next <em>getConnection</em> request from
the application can return a connection from the pool that is also stale,
resulting in more stale connection exceptions.</dd>
