<h2>Administrative console scope settings</h2>

<p>Use Scope settings to filter the contents of an administrative
 console collection table to a particular cell, node, or server.
Changing the value for <strong>Scope</strong> allows you to see other  variables that
apply to an object and might change the contents of the  collection table.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Browse</strong> next to a field to see choices for limiting the scope
 of the field. If a field is read-only, you cannot change the scope. For example,
 if only one server exists, you cannot switch the scope to a different server.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Cell</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Limits the visibility to all servers on the named cell.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Node</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Limits the visibility to all servers on the named node.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Server</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Limits the visibility to the named server.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The server scope has precedence over the node and cell scopes, and the
node  scope has precedence over the cell scope. Note that objects are created
at  only one scope, though they might be visible at more than one scope.</p>
