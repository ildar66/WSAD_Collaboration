<h2>Administrative console page features</h2>

<p>This topic provides information about the basic elements of an
administrative console page, such as the various tabs one can expect to encounter.</p>

<p>Administrative console pages are arranged in a few basic patterns. Understanding
their layout and behavior will help you use them more easily.</p>

<p>
<strong>Collection pages</strong>
</p>

<p>Use collection pages to manage a collection of existing administrative
objects. A collection page typically contains one or more of the following
elements:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Scope, Filter, and Preferences</strong>
</dt>
<dd>These are described in <a href="rcon_scope.html">Administrative console scope settings</a>, <a href="rcon_filter.html">Administrative console filter settings</a>, and <a href="rcon_preferences.html">Administrative console preference settings</a>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Table of existing objects</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The table displays existing administrative objects of the type specified
by the collection page. The table columns summarize the values of the key
settings for these objects. If no objects exist yet, an empty table is displayed.
Use the available buttons to create a new object.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Buttons for performing actions</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The available buttons are described in <a href="rcon_buttons.html">Administrative console buttons</a>. In most cases, you need to select one or more
of the objects in the table, then click a button. The action will be applied
to the selected objects.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Sort toggle buttons</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Following column headings in the table are icons for  sort ascending (^)
and sort descending (v). By default, items such as names are  sorted in descending
order (alphabetically). To enable another sorting order, click  on the icons
for the column whose items you want sorted.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<strong>Detail pages</strong>
</p>

<p>Use detail pages to configure specific administrative objects, such as
an application server. A detail page typically contains one or more of the
following elements:</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Configuration tabbed page</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This tabbed page is for modifying the configuration of an administrative
object.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Runtime tabbed page</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This tabbed page displays the configuration that is currently in use for
the administrative object. It is read-only in most cases.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Buttons for performing actions</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The available buttons are described in <a href="rcon_buttons.html">Administrative console buttons</a>.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
<strong>Wizard pages</strong>
</p>

<p>Use wizard pages to complete a configuration process comprised of several
steps. Be aware that wizards show or hide certain steps depending on the characteristics
of the specific object you are configuring.</p>
