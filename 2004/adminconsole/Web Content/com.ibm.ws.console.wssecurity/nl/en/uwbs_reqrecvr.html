<h2>Request receiver binding collection</h2>

<p>Use this page to specify the binding configuration to receive request
messages for Web services security.</p>

<li>Under Related Items, click <strong>Web Modules</strong> &gt; <em>URI_file_name</em> &gt; <strong>Web

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_signing"></a>Signing Information</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the configuration for the signing parameters. Signing
information is used to sign and validate parts of a message including the
body, time stamp, and user name token. 
<p>You also can use these parameters for X.509 certificate validation when
Authentication Method is IDAssertion and ID Type is X509Certificate in the
server-level configuration. In such cases, you must fill in the <strong>Certificate
Path</strong> fields only.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_encrypt"></a>Encryption Information</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the configuration for the encrypting and decrypting parameters.
This configuration is used to encrypt and decrypt parts of the message that
include the body and user name token.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_trustancdescr"></a>Trust Anchors</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of keystore objects that contain the trusted root
certificates that are issued by a certificate authority (CA). 
<p>The certificate authority authenticates a user and issues a certificate.
The CertPath API uses the certificate to validate the certificate chain of
incoming, X.509-formatted security tokens or trusted, self-signed certificates.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_collcert"></a>Collection Certificate Store</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of the untrusted, intermediate certificate files. 
<p>The collection certificate store contains a chain of untrusted, intermediate
certificates.The CertPath API attempts to validate these certificates, which
are based on the trust anchor.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_keyldesc"></a>Key Locators</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of key locator objects that retrieve the keys
for digital signature and encryption from a keystore file or a repository.
The key locator maps a name or logical name to an alias or maps an authenticated
identity to a key. This logical name is used to locate a key in a key locator
implementation.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_trstiddesc"></a>Trusted ID Evaluators</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of trusted ID evaluators that determine whether
to trust the identity-asserting authority or message sender.
<p>The trusted ID evaluators are used to authenticate additional identities
from one server to another server. For example, a client sends the identity
of user A to server 1 for authentication. Server 1 calls downstream to server
2, asserts the identity of user A, and includes the user ID and password of
server 1. Server 2 attempts to establish trust with server 1 by authenticating
its user ID and password and checking the trust based on the TrustedIDEvaluator
implementation. If the authentication process and the trust check are successful,
server 2 trusts that server 1 authenticated user A and a credential is created
for user A on server 2 to invoke the request.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_logmapdesc"></a>Login Mappings</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of configurations for validating tokens within
incoming messages.
<p>Login mappings map the authentication method to the Java Authentication
and Authorization Service (JAAS) configuration.</p>

<p>To configure JAAS, use the administrative console and click <strong>Security
&gt; JAAS Configuration</strong>.</p>
