<h2>Login mappings collection</h2>

<p>Use this page to view a list of configurations for validating security
tokens within incoming messages. Login mappings map an authentication method
to a Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) login configuration
to validate the security token. Four authentication methods are predefined
in the WebSphere Application Server: BasicAuth, Signature, IDAssertion, and LTPA.</p>

<p>To view this administrative console page, complete the following steps: <ol>

<li>Click <strong>Server &gt; Application Servers &gt; </strong><em>server_name</em>. </li>

<li>Under Additional Properties, click <strong>Web Services: Default bindings for
Web Services Security &gt; Login Mappings</strong>.</li>

</ol>
</p>

<p>Click <strong>New</strong> to create a login mapping.</p>

<p>Click <strong>Delete</strong> to delete a login mapping.</p>

<p>If you click <strong>Update runtime</strong>, the Web services security run time
is updated with the default binding information, which is contained in the <samp>ws-security.xml</samp> file
that was previously saved. After you specify the authentication method, the
Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS) configuration name, and
the Callback Handler Factory class name on this panel, you must complete the
following steps:</p>

<p>Click <strong>Save</strong> at the top of the administrative console. When you click <strong>Save</strong>,
you return to the administrative console home panel. </p>

<p>Return to the Login Mappings collection panel and click <strong>Update runtime</strong>.</p>

<p>
<b>Note: </b>When you click <strong>Update runtime</strong>, the configuration
changes made to the other Web services also are updated in the Web services
security run time.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_authmeth"></a>Authentication Method</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the authentication method used for validating the security
tokens.
<p>The following authentication methods are available:<dl>
<dt>
<strong>BasicAuth</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Basic authentication includes both a user name and password in the security
token. The information in the token is authenticated by the receiving server
and used to create a credential.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Signature</strong>
</dt>
<dd>When the authentication method is signature, an X.509 certificate is sent
as a security token. For Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) registries,
the distinguished name (DN) is mapped to a credential, which is based on the
LDAP certificate filter settings. For local OS registries, the first attribute
of the certificate, usually the common name (CN) is mapped directly to a user
ID in the registry.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>IDAssertion</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Identity assertion maps a trusted identity (ID) to a WebSphere credential.
This authentication method only includes a user name in the security token.
An additional token is included in the message for trust purposes. Once the
additional token is trusted, the IDAssertion token user name is mapped to
a credential. </dd>
<dt>
<strong>LTPA</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Lightweight Third Party Authentication (LTPA) validates an LTPA token.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_jaasconfg"></a>JAAS Configuration Name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the name of the Java Authentication and Authorization
Service (JAAS) configuration.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_classname"></a>Callback Handler Factory Class Name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the name of the factory for the CallbackHandler class.</dd>
