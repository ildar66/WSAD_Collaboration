<h2>Administrative console buttons</h2>

<p>This page describes the button choices that are available on various
pages of the administrative console, depending on which product features you
have enabled.</p>

<ul>

<li>
<strong>Abort. </strong>Aborts a transaction that is not yet in the prepared state.
All operations that the transaction completed are undone.</li>

<li>
<strong>Add. </strong>Adds the selected or typed item to a list, or produces a dialog
 for adding an item to a list.</li>


<li>
<strong>Apply. </strong>Saves your changes to a page without exiting the page.</li>

<li>
<strong>Back. </strong>Displays the previous page or item in a sequence.  Note that
the administrative console does not support using the Back and  Forward buttons
of a browser. Using those buttons can cause intermittent  problems. Use the
Back or Cancel buttons on the administrative console panels  instead.</li>

<li>
<strong>Browse. </strong>Opens a dialog that enables you to look for a file on your
system.</li>

<li>
<strong>Cancel. </strong>Exits the current page or dialog, discarding unsaved changes.
 Note that the administrative console does not support using the Back and
 Forward buttons of a browser. Using those buttons can cause intermittent
 problems. Use the Cancel button on the administrative console panels instead.</li>

<li>
<strong>Change. </strong>In the context of security, lets you  search the user registry
for a user ID for an application to run under.  In the context of container
properties, lets you change the data source the  container is using.</li>

<li>
<strong>Clear. </strong>Clears your changes and restores the most  recently saved
values.</li>

<li>
<strong>Clear Selections. </strong>Clears any selected cells in the tables on this
tabbed page.</li>

<li>
<strong>Close. </strong>Exits the dialog.</li>

<li>
<strong>Commit. </strong>Releases all locks held by a prepared transaction and forces
the transaction to commit.</li>

<li>
<strong>Copy. </strong>Creates copies of the selected application servers.</li>

<li>
<strong>Create. </strong>Saves your changes to all tabbed pages  in a dialog and
exits the dialog.</li>

<li>
<strong>Delete. </strong>Removes the selected instance.</li>

<li>
<strong>Details. </strong>Shows the details about a transaction.</li>

<li>
<strong>Done. </strong>Saves your changes to all tabbed pages  in a dialog and exits
the dialog.</li>

<li>
<strong>Down. </strong>Moves downward through a list.</li>

<li>
<strong>Dump. </strong>Activates a dump of a traced application server.</li>

<li>
<strong>Edit. </strong>Lets you edit the selected item in a list,  or produces a
dialog box for editing the item.</li>

<li>
<strong>Export. </strong>Accesses a page for exporting EAR files for an enterprise
application.</li>

<li>
<strong>Export DDL. </strong>Accesses a page for exporting DDL files for an enterprise
 application.</li>

<li>
<strong>Export Keys. </strong>Exports LTPA keys to other domains.</li>

<li>
<strong>Filter. </strong>Produces a dialog box for specifying  the resources to
view in the tables on this tabbed page.</li>

<li>
<strong>Finish. </strong>Forces a transaction to finish, regardless  of whether
its outcome has been reported to all participating applications.</li>

<li>
<strong>First. </strong>Displays the first record in a series  of records.</li>


<li>
<strong>Generate Keys. </strong>Generates new LTPA keys. When security is turned
on for  the first time with LTPA as the authentication mechanism, LTPA keys
are  automatically generated with the password entered in the panel. If new
keys need  to be generated, use this button after the server is back up with
security turned on.  Clicking this button generates the keys and propagates
them to all active servers  (cell, node, and application servers). The new
keys can be used to encrypt and decrypt  the LTPA tokens. Click <strong>Save</strong> on
the console taskbar to save the new keys and  the password in the repository.</li>

<li>
<strong>Immediate Stop. </strong> Stops the server, but bypasses the normal server
quiesce process that would allow in-flight requests to complete before shutting
down the whole server process. This shutdown mode is faster than the normal
server stop processing, but some application clients may receive exceptions.</li>

<li>
<strong>Import Keys. </strong>Imports new LTPA keys from other domains. To support
 single sign on (SSO) in WebSphere across multiple WebSphere domains (cells),
 LTPA keys and a password should be shared among the domains. After exporting
the  keys from one of the cells into a file, clicking this button imports
the keys into  all active servers (cell, node and application servers). The
new keys can be used  to encrypt and decrypt the LTPA token. Click <strong>Save</strong> on
the console taskbar  to save the new keys and the password in the repository.</li>

<li>
<strong>Install. </strong>Displays the Preparing for application install page, which
you  use to deploy an application or EJB or Web component onto an application
server.</li>

<li>
<strong>Install RAR.</strong>The Install RAR button opens a dialog used to install
a JCA connector and create a resource adapter for it.</li>

because a transactional resource is not available.</li>
