<h2>Common Secure Interoperability outbound authentication settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to specify the features that a server supports when
acting as a client to another downstream server.</p>

<p>To view this administrative console page, click <strong>Security &gt; Authentication
Protocol &gt; CSI Outbound Authentication</strong>.</p>

<p>Authentication features include three layers of authentication that you
can use simultaneously:  <dl>
<dt>
<strong>Transport layer</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The transport layer, the lowest layer, might contain a Secure Sockets
:Layer (SSL) client certificate as the identity.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Message layer</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The message layer might contain a user ID and password or authenticated
token.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Attribute layer</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The attribute layer might contain an identity token, which is an identity
from an upstream server that is already authenticated. The attribute layer
has the highest priority, followed by the message layer and then the transport
layer. If this server sends all three, only the attribute layer
is used by the downstream server. The only way to use the SSL client certificate
as the identity is if it is the only information presented during the outbound
request.</dd>
</dl>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="BasicAuthentication_o_description"></a>Basic Authentication</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies whether to send a user ID and a password from the client
to the server for authentication.
<p>This type of authentication occurs over the message layer. Basic authentication
also involves delegating a credential token from an already authenticated
credential, provided the credential type is forwardable (for example, Lightweight
Third Party Authentication (LTPA)). Basic authentication refers to any authentication
over the message layer and indicates user ID and password as well as token-based
authentication.</p>

<p>Selecting <strong>Basic Authentication</strong> determines whether it is required
or supported. Selecting <strong>Required</strong> indicates that when the server goes
outbound to downstream servers, the downstream server must support basic authentication
for this server to connect. Selecting <strong>Supported</strong> indicates that this
server might or might not perform basic authentication to a downstream server.
Other methods of authentication can occur if configured. Selecting <strong>Never</strong>,
indicates that this server never sends a message layer token outbound to a
downstream server. If the downstream server requires basic authentication,
then the connection is not attempted.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="ClientCertificateAuthentication_o_description"></a>Client Certificate Authentication</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies whether a client certificate from the configured keystore
file is used to authenticate to the server when the SSL connection is made
between this server and a downstream server (provided that the downstream
server supports client certificate authentication).
<p>Typically, client certificate authentication has a higher performance than
message layer authentication, but requires some additional setup steps. These
additional steps include verifying that this server has a personal certificate
and the downstream server has the signer certificate of this server.</p>

<p>If you select client certificate authentication, decide whether it is required
or supported.  Selecting <strong>Required</strong> indicates that this server can only
connect to downstream servers with client certificate authentication also
configured. Selecting <strong>Supported</strong> indicates that this server performs
client certificate authentication with any downstream server, but might not
use client certificate authentication depending on whether it is supported
by the downstream server. Selecting <strong>Never</strong> indicates that this client
does not perform client certificate authentication to any downstream server.
This limitation prevents access to any downstream server that requires client
certificate authentication.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="IdentityAssertion_o_description"></a>Identity Assertion</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies whether to assert identities from one server to another
during a downstream enterprise bean invocation. 
<p>The identity asserted is the invocation credential that is determined by
the RunAs mode for the enterprise bean. If the RunAs mode is <strong>Client</strong>,
the identity is the client identity. If the RunAs mode is <strong>System</strong>, the
identity is the server identity. If the RunAs mode is <strong>Specified</strong>, the
identity is the identity specified. The receiving server receives the identity
in an identity token and also receives the sending server identity in a client
authentication token.  The receiving server validates the identity of the
sending server to ensure a trusted identity.</p>

<p>When specifying identity assertion on the <strong>CSIv2 Authentication Outbound</strong> panel,
you must also select basic authentication as supported or required on the
CSIv2 Authentication Outbound panel. This action allows the server identity
to be submitted, along with the identity token, so that the receiving server
can <em>trust</em> the sending server. Without specifying basic authentication
as supported or required, trust is not established and the identity assertion
fails. </p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="StatefulSession_description"></a>Stateful Sessions </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies whether to reuse security information during authentication.
This option is usually used to increase performance.
<p>The first contact between a client and server must fully authenticate.
However, all subsequent contacts with valid sessions, reuse the security information.
The client passes  a context ID to the server, and that ID is used to look
up the session. The context ID is scoped to the connection, which guarantees
uniqueness. Whenever the security session is invalid and if authentication
retry is enabled (it is enabled by default), the client-side security interceptor
invalidates the client-side session and resubmits the request transparently.
For example, if the session does not exist on the server; the server fails
and resumes operation.</p>

<p>When this value is disabled, every method invocation must re-authenticate.</p>
