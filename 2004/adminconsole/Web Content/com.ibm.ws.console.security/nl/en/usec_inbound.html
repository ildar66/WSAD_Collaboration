<h2>Common Secure Interoperability inbound authentication settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to specify the features that a server supports for
a client accessing its resources.</p>

<p>To view this administrative console page, click <strong>Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Authentication
Protocol</strong> &gt; <strong>CSI Inbound Authentication</strong>.</p>

<p>CSI inbound authentication settings for configuring the type of authentication
information contained in an incoming request or transport.</p>

<p>Authentication features include three layers of authentication that you
can use simultaneously:  <ul>

<li>
<strong>Transport layer</strong>. The transport layer, the lowest layer, might contain
a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) client certificate as the identity.</li>

<li>
<strong>Message layer</strong>. The message layer might contain a user ID and password
or an expirable authenticated token.</li>

<li>
<strong>Attribute layer</strong>. The attribute layer might contain an identity
token, which is an identity from an upstream server that already is authenticated.
The identity layer has the highest priority, followed by the message layer
and then the transport layer. If a client sends all three, only the identity
layer is used. The only way to use the SSL client certificate as the identity
is if it is the only information presented during the request. The client
picks up the IOR from the name space and reads the values from the tagged component
to determine what the server needs for security. </li>

</ul>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="BasicAuthentication_i_description"></a>Basic Authentication </strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies that basic authentication occurs over the message layer.
<p>In the message layer, basic authentication (user ID and password) takes
place. This type of authentication typically involves sending a user ID and
password from the client to the server for authentication.  This also involves
delegating a credential token from an already authenticated credential, provided
the credential type is forwardable (for example, Lightweight Third Party Authentication
(LTPA)). If <strong>Basic Authentication</strong> is selected for the server, specify
both user ID and password authentication as well as token-based authentication.</p>

<p>When selecting <strong>Basic Authentication</strong>, you need to decide whether
it is <strong>Required</strong> or <strong>Supported</strong>.  Selecting <strong>Required</strong>, indicates
only clients configured to authenticate to this server through the message
layer are allowed to invoke requests on the server. Selecting supported, indicates
that this server accepts <strong>Basic Authentication</strong>. However, other methods
of authentication can occur if configured and anonymous requests are accepted.
Selecting <strong>Never</strong>, indicates that the server is not configured to accept
message layer authentication from any client.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="ClientCertificateAuthentication_i_description"></a>Client Certificate Authentication</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies that authentication occurs when the initial connection
is made between the client and server during a method request.
<p>In the transport layer, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) client certificate authentication
takes place. In the message layer, basic authentication (user ID and password)
is performed. Client certificate authentication typically performs better
than message layer authentication, but requires some additional setup steps.
These additional steps involve ensuring that the server has the signer certificate
of each client to which it is connected. If the client uses a certificate
authority (CA) to create its personal certificate, then you need only the CA
root certificate in the server signer section of the SSL trust file. When
the certificate is authenticated to an Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
user registry, the distinguished name (DN) is mapped based on the filter specified
when configuring LDAP. When the certificate is authenticated to a Local OS
user registry, the first attribute of the DN in the certificate (typically
the common name) is mapped to the user ID in the registry. The identity from
client certificates is used only if no other layer of authentication is presented
to the server.</p>

<p>When selecting <strong>Client Certificate Authentication</strong>, you need to decide
whether it is <strong>Required</strong> or <strong>Supported</strong>. When selecting <strong>Required</strong>,
only clients that are configured to authenticate to this server through SSL
client certificates can invoke requests on the server. When selecting <strong>Supported</strong>,
this server accepts SSL client certificate authentication, however, other
methods of authentication can occur (if configured) and anonymous requests
are accepted. When selecting <strong>Never</strong>, this server is not configured to
accept client certificate authentication from any client.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="IdentityAssertion_i_description"></a>Identity Assertion</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies that identity assertion is a way to assert identities
from one server to another during a downstream EJB invocation.
<p>Identity assertion is performed in the attribute layer and is only applicable
on servers. The principal determined at the server is based on precedence
rules. If identity assertion is performed, the identity is always derived
from the attribute. If basic authentication is performed without identity
assertion, the identity is always derived from the message layer. Finally,
if SSL client certificate authentication is performed without either basic
authentication, or identity assertion, then the identity is derived from the
transport layer.</p>

<p>The identity asserted is the invocation credential that is determined by
the RunAs mode for the enterprise bean. If the RunAs mode is <strong>Client</strong>,
the identity is the client identity. If the RunAs mode is <strong>System</strong>, the
identity is the server identity.  If the RunAs mode is <strong>Specified</strong>, the
identity is the one specified. The receiving server receives the identity
in an identity token and also receives the sending server identity in a client
authentication token. The receiving server validates the sending server identity
as a trusted identity through the <strong>Trusted Server IDs</strong> entry box. Enter
a list of comma-separated principal names, for example, <samp>serverid1, serverid2,
serverid3</samp>.</p>

<p>When authenticating to a LocalOS user registry, all identity token types
map to the user ID field of the active user registry. For an <samp>ITTPrincipal</samp> identity
token, this maps one-to-one with the user ID fields. For an <samp>ITTDistinguishedName</samp> identity
token, the value from the first equal sign is mapped to the user ID field.
For an <samp>ITTCertChain</samp> identity token, the value from the first equal
sign of the distinguished name is mapped to the user ID field.</p>

<p>When authenticating to an LDAP user registry, the LDAP filters determine
how an identity of type <samp>ITTCertChain</samp> and <samp>ITTDistinguishedName</samp> get
mapped to the registry. If the token type is <samp>ITTPrincipal</samp>, then the
principal gets mapped to the UID field in the LDAP registry.</p>

<dt>
<strong><a name="IdentityAssertionLayer_trustedServers_description"></a>Trusted Server User IDs</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a comma-separated list of server user IDs, which are
trusted to perform identity assertion to this server.
<p>Use this list to quickly decide whether a server is trusted. Even if the
server is on the list, the sending server must still authenticate with the
receiving server to accept the identity token of the sending server.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="StatefulSession_description"></a>Stateful Sessions</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies stateful sessions, used mostly for performance improvements.
<p>The first contact between a client and server must fully authenticate.
However, all subsequent contacts with valid sessions, reuse the security information.
The client passes a context ID to the server, and the ID is used to look up
the session. The context ID is scoped to the connection, which guarantees
uniqueness. Whenever the security session is invalid and the authentication
retry is enabled (it is by default), the client-side security interceptor
invalidate the client-side session and resubmits the request without user
awareness. This might occur if the session does not exist on the server (the
server failed and resumed operation). When this value is disabled, every method
invocation must re-authenticate.</p>
