<h2>Java virtual machine (JVM) log settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to view and modify the settings for the Java virtual
machine (JVM) <samp>System.out</samp> and <samp>System.err</samp> logs.</p>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="system_out_file_description"></a>File Name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the name of one of the log file described on this page. 
<p>The first file name field specifies the name of the <samp>System.out</samp> log.
The second file name field specifies the name of the <samp>System.err</samp> file. </p>

<p>Press the <strong>View</strong> button on the Runtime tab to view the contents of
a selected log file.</p>

<p>The file name specified for the <samp>System.out</samp> log or the <samp>System.err</samp> log
must have one of the following values:<dl>
<dt>
<strong><em>filename</em></strong>
</dt>
<dd>The name of a file in the file system. It is recommended that you use
a fully qualified file name. If the file name is not fully qualified, it is
considered to be relative to the current working directory for the server.
Each stream must be configured with a dedicated file. For example, you cannot
redirect both <samp>System.out</samp> and <samp>System.err</samp> to the same physical
file.<p>If the directory containing the file already exists, the user ID under
which the server is running requires read/write access to the directory. If
the directory does not exist, it will be created with the proper permissions.
The user id under which the server is running must have authority to create
the directory.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>console</strong>
</dt>
<dd>This is a special file name used to redirect the stream to the corresponding
process stream. If this value is specified for <samp>System.out</samp>, the file
is redirected to <samp>stdout</samp>. If this value is specified for <samp>System.err</samp>,
the file is redirected to <samp>stderr</samp>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>none</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Discards all data written to the stream. Specifying <strong>none</strong> is equivalent
to redirecting the stream to dev/null on a UNIX system.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="system_out_file_formatting_description"></a>File formatting</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the format to use in saving the <samp>System.out</samp> file.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="log_file_rotation"></a>Log file rotation</strong>
</dt>
<dd>

<p>Use this set of configuration attributes to configure the <samp>System.out</samp> or <samp>System.err</samp> log
 file to be self-managing.</p>

<p>A self-managing log file writes messages to a file until reaching either
the time or size criterion. At the specified time or when the file reaches
the specified size, logging temporarily suspends while the log file rolls
over, which involves closing and renaming the saved file. The new saved file
name is based on the original name of the file plus a timestamp qualifier
that indicates when the renaming occurs. Once the renaming completes, a new,
empty log file with the original name reopens and logging resumes. All messages
remain after the log file rollover, although a single message can split across
the saved and the current file.</p>

<p>You can only configure a log to be self-managing if the corresponding stream
is redirected to a file.<dl>
<dt>
<strong>File Size</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Click this attribute for the log file to manage itself based on its file
size. Automatic roll over occurs when the file reaches the specified size
you specify in the maximum size field.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Maximum Size</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specify the maximum size of the file in megabytes. When the file reaches
this size, it rolls over.<p>This attribute is only valid if you click File
size.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Time</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Click this attribute for the log file to manage itself based on the time
of day. At the time specified in the start time field, the file rolls over.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Start Time</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specify the hour of the day, from 1 to 24, when the periodic rollover
algorithm starts for the first time after an Application Server restart. The
algorithm loads at Application Server startup. Once started at the (start
time field) hour, the rollover algorithm rolls the file every (repeat time
field) hours. This rollover pattern continues without adjustment until the
Application Server stops. </dd>
<dt>
<strong>Repeat Time</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specify the number of hours, from 1 to 24, when a periodic rollover occurs.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Repeat time</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of hours after which the log file rolls over. Valid
values range from 1 to 24. </dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>Configure a log file to roll over by time, by size, or by time and size.
Click <strong>File Size</strong> and <strong>Time</strong> to roll the file at the first matching
criterion. For example, if the repeat time field is 5 hours and the maximum
file size is 2 MB, the file rolls every 5 hours, unless it reaches 2 MB before
the interval elapses. After the size rollover, the file continues to roll
at each interval.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="max_historical_files"></a>Maximum Number of Historical Log Files</strong>
</dt>
<dd>

<p>Specifies the number of historical (rolled) files to keep. The stream writes
to the current file until it rolls. At rollover, the current file closes and
is saved as a new name consisting of the current name plus the rollover timestamp.
The stream then reopens a new file with the original name to continue writing.
The number of historical files grows from zero to the value of the maximum
number of historical files field. The next rollover deletes the oldest historical
file.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="installed_application_output"></a>Installed Application Output</strong>
</dt>
<dd>

<p>Specifies whether <samp>System.out</samp> or <samp>System.err</samp> print statements
issued from application code are logged and formatted.<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Show application print statements</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Click this field to show messages that applications write to the stream
using <strong>print</strong> and <strong>println</strong> stream methods. WebSphere Application
Server system messages always appear.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Format print statements</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Click this field to format application print statement like WebSphere
Application Server system messages.</dd>
