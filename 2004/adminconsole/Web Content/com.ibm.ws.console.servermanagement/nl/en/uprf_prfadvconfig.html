<h2>Runtime Performance Advisor configuration settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to specify settings for the Runtime Performance Advisor.</p>

<p>For more information on how to use the Runtime Performance Advisor, see <a href="tprf_enpadvice.html">Using the Runtime Performance Advisor</a>. </p>

<p>To view this administrative page, click <strong>Servers</strong> &gt; <strong>Application
Servers</strong> &gt; <em>server_name</em> &gt; <strong>Runtime Performance Advisor Configuration</strong>.</p>

<div>
<p>
<strong>Configuration tab</strong>

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="RPARuleEngine_enabled_description"></a>Enable Runtime Performance Advisor</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies whether the Runtime Performance Advisor will run on server
startup. 
<p>The Runtime Performance Advisor (RPA) requires that the Performance Monitoring
Service be enabled. It does not require that individual counters be enabled.
When a counter that is needed by RPA is not enabled, RPA will enable it automatically.
When disabling the Runtime Performance Advisor the user may want to disable
the PMI Service or the counters that RPA enabled. The following counters may
be enabled by RPA: <ul>

<li>ThreadPools</li>

<li>Web Container Pool Size</li>

<li>Active Threads</li>

<li>Object Request Broker Pool Size</li>

<li>Active Threads</li>

<li>JDBC Connection Pools</li>

<li>Pool size</li>

<li>Percent used</li>

<li>Prepared Statement Discards</li>

<li>Servlet Session Manager</li>

<li>External Read Size</li>

<li>External Write Size</li>

<li>External Read Time</li>

<li>External Write Time</li>

<li>No Room For New Session</li>

</ul> 
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="RPARuleEngine_calculationInterval_description"></a>Calculation Interval</strong>
</dt>
<dd>PMI data is taken over an interval of time and averaged to provide
advice. The calculation interval specifies the length of the time over which
data is taken for this advice. Details within the advice messages will appear
as averages over this interval.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="RPARuleEngine_maxAlertStreak_description"></a>Maximum warning sequence</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The maximum warning sequence refers to the number of consecutive
warnings issued before the threshold is relaxed.
<p>For example, if the maximum warning sequence is set to 3, then the advisor
only sends three warnings to indicate that the prepared statement cache is
overflowing. After that, a new alert is only issued if the rate of discards
exceeds the new threshold setting.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="RPARuleEngine_numberOfProcessors_description"></a>Number of processors</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of processors on the server.
<p>This setting is critical to ensure accurate advice for the system's specific
configuration.</p>

<strong><a name="field_name"></a>Restart button</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Selecting Restart on the Runtime tab reinitializes the Runtime
Performance Advisor using the last information saved to disk.  Note that this
action also resets the state of the Runtime Performance Advisor.  For example,
the current warning sequence is reset to zero for each recommendation/advice.</dd>
