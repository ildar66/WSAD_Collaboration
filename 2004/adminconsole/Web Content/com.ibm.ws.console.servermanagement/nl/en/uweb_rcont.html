host with some common aliases,  such as the machine IP address, short host
name, and fully qualified host name.  The alias comprises the first part of
the path for accessing a resource such as a servlet.  For example, it is <samp>localhost:9080</samp>
in the request <samp>http://localhost:9080/myServlet</samp>.</dd>

<strong><a name="rcont_cache"></a>Servlet caching</strong>
</dt>

These side effects can include calls to other servlets or Java Server Pages (JSP) files,
 as well as metadata about the entry, including timeout and entry priority information.
