<h2>Response receiver binding collection</h2>

<p>Use this page to specify the binding configuration for receiver
response messages for Web services security.</p>

<li>Click <strong>Applications &gt; Enterprise Applications &gt; </strong><em>application_name</em>.</li>

<li>Under Related Items, click <strong>Web Modules</strong> &gt; <em>URI_file_name</em> &gt; <strong>Web

<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_signing"></a>Signing Information</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the configuration for the signing parameters. Signing
information is used to sign and validate parts of the message including the
body and time stamp.
<p>You can also use these parameters for X.509 validation when <em>Authentication
Method</em> is <samp>IDAssertion</samp> and <em>ID Type</em> is <samp>X509Certificate</samp> in
the server-level configuration. In such cases, you must fill in the <em>Certificate
Path </em> fields only.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_encrypt"></a>Encryption Information</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the configuration for the encrypting and decrypting parameters.
Encryption information is used for encrypting and decrypting various parts
of a message including the body and user name token.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_trustancdescr"></a>Trust Anchors</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of keystore objects that contain the trusted root
certificates, that are self-signed or issued by a certificate authority.
<p>The certificate authority authenticates a user and issues a certificate.
After the certificate is issued, the key store objects, which contain these
certificates, use the certificate for certificate path or certificate chain
validation of incoming X.509-formatted security tokens.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_collcert"></a>Collection Certificate Store</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of the untrusted, intermediate certificate files.
<p>The collection certificate store contains a chain of untrusted, intermediate
certificates.The CertPath API attempts to validate these certificates, which
are based on the trust anchor.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="sec_keyldesc"></a>Key Locators</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a list of key locator objects that retrieve the keys
for digital signature and encryption from a key store file or a repository.
The key locator maps a name or logical name to an alias or maps an authenticated
identity to a key. This logical name is used to locate a key in a key locator
implementation.</dd>
