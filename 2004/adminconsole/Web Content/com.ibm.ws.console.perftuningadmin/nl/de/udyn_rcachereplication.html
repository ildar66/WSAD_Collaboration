<h2>Internal messaging configuration settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to set advanced configurations for Memory to Memory
session replication.</p>

<p>To view this administrative console page, click <strong>Servers</strong> &gt; <strong>Application
Servers</strong> &gt; <em>server</em> &gt; <strong>Dynamic Cache Service</strong>&gt; <strong>Cache replication</strong> &gt; <strong>Enable
cache replication</strong> .</p>

<p>The advanced replication settings include fields for choosing the initial
replicator entry that connects to the replicator domains. As an alternative,
you can specify the IP addresses and ports (of the form address:port) for
connection to replicators outside of the cell that the server is administered
under. By default, if a replicator is defined on the server you are configuring,
that server is the one chosen for cache replication. Select the advanced properties
only if you want to deviate from the default setting.</p>

<strong><a name="DRSSettings_internalMessagingServer_description"></a>Internal messaging server</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies a domain from which your data will be replicated. Depending
on the domain you choose to replicate the data, you can choose any of the
replicators defined under that domain. You can use the default domain or choose
one from the drop down window.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="DRSSettings_runtimeMode_description"></a>Runtime mode</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the global sharing policy for this server. 
<p>The following settings are available:<ul>

<li>
<strong>Both push and pull</strong> sends the cache ID of newly updated content
to other servers in the replication domain.  Then, if one of the other servers
requests the content, and that server has the ID of the cache entry for the
previously updated content, it will retrieve the content from the publishing
server.  On the other hand, if a request is made for an ID which has not been
previously published, the server assumes it does not exist in the cluster
and creates a new entry.</li>

<li>
<strong>Push only</strong> sends the cache ID and cache content of new content to
all other servers in the replication domain.</li>

<li>The sharing policy of <strong>Not Shared</strong> results in the cache ID and cache
content not being shared with other servers in the replication domain.</li>

</ul>
</p>

<p>The default setting for a non-clustered environment is <strong>Not Shared</strong>.
When enabling replication, the default value is <strong>Push only</strong>. </p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="DynamicCache_DRSSettings_pushFrequency_description"></a>Push frequency</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the time in seconds to wait before pushing new or modified
cache entries to other servers. A value of 0 (zero) means send immediately.
<p>Setting this property to a value greater than 0 (zero) causes a "batch"
push of all cache entries that are created or modified during the time period.</p>
