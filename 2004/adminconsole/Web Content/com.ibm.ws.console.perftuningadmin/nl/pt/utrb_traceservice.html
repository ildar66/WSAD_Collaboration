<h2>Diagnostic trace service settings</h2>

<p>Use this page to review and modify the properties of the diagnostic
trace service.</p>

<p>To view this page, click <strong>Troubleshooting &gt; Logs and Trace &gt; <em>server</em> &gt;
Diagnostic trace</strong>.</p>

<div>
<p>
<strong>Configuration tab</strong>
</p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong><a name="enable_trace_service_description"></a>Enable Trace</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Enables the trace service.
<p>If this option is not selected, the following configuration properties
are not passed to the application server trace service at server startup.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="trace_spec_description"></a>Trace Specification</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies tracing details.
<p>Enter a trace string that specifies the components, packages, or groups
to trace. The trace string must conform to the specific grammar described
below. You can enter the trace string directly, or generate it using the graphical
trace interface. Click <strong>Modify</strong> to start the graphical trace interface.</p>

<p>If you start the graphical trace interface from the configuration tab,
a list of well-known components, packages, and groups is displayed. This list
might not be exhaustive.</p>

<p>If you start the graphical trace interface from the runtime tab, the list
of components, packages, and groups displays all such components currently
registered on the running server.</p>

<p>The format of the trace specification is:<pre>&lt;<em>component</em>&gt; = &lt;<em>trace_type</em>&gt;= enabled | disabled</pre> where:
&lt;<em>component</em>&gt; is the component for which to enable or disable tracing,
and &lt;<em>trace_type</em>&gt; is the type of tracing to enable or disable. Separate
multiple tracing specifications with colons (:).</p>

<p>Components correspond to Java packages and classes, or to collections of
Java packages. Use * as a wildcard to indicate components that include all
classes in all packages contained by the specified component. For example:<dl>
<dt>
<strong><samp>*</samp></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies all traceable code running in the application server, including
WebSphere Application Server system code and customer code.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><samp>com.ibm.ws.*</samp></strong>
</dt>
<dd>specifies all classes whose package name begins with <samp>com.ibm.ws</samp>.</dd>
<dt>
<strong><samp>com.ibm.ws.classloader.JarClassLoader</samp></strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies only the JarClassLoader class.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>For more information on trace string grammar, see the article <cite>Enabling
trace</cite> in the WebSphere Application Server InfoCenter.</p>

<p>
<b>Note: </b>An error can occur when setting a trace specification from
the adminstrative console if selections are made from both the Groups and
Components lists. In some cases, the selection made from one list is not lost
when adding a selection from the other list. To work around this problem,
enter the desired trace specification directly into the Trace Specification
entry field.</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="trace_output_description"></a>Trace Output</strong>
            &nbsp;
            </dt>
<dd>Specifies where trace output should be written.
<p>The trace output can be written directly to an output file, or stored in
memory and written to a file on demand using the Dump button found on the
run-time page.</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Memory Buffer</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies that the trace output should be written to an in-memory circular
buffer. If you select this option you must specify the following parameters:<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Maximum Buffer Size</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the number of entries, in thousands, that can be cached in the
buffer. When this number is exceeded, older entries are overwritten by new
entries.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Dump File Name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>The name of the file to which the memory buffer will be written when it
is dumped. This option is only available from the Runtime tab.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>File</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies to write the trace output to a self-managing log file.<p>The
self-managing log file writes messages to the file until a size criteria is
reached. When the file reaches the specified size, logging is temporarily
suspended and the log file is closed and renamed. The new name is based on
the original name of the file, plus a timestamp qualifier that indicates when
the renaming occurred. Once the renaming is complete, a new, empty log file
with the original name is reopened, and logging resumes. No messages are lost
as a result of the rollover, although a single message may be split across
the two files.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</p>

<p>If you select this option you must specify the following parameters:<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Maximum File Size</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum size, in megabytes, to which the output file is
allowed to grow. <p>This attribute is only valid if the File Size attribute
is selected. When the file reaches this size, it is rolled over as described
above.</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Maximum Number of Historical Files</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the maximum number of rolled over files to keep.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>File Name</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Specifies the name of the file to which the trace output is written.</dd>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="trace_format_description"></a>Trace Output Format</strong>
            &nbsp;
            </dt>
<dd>Specifies the format of the trace output.
<p>You can specify one of three levels for trace output:<dl>

<dt>
<strong>Basic (Compatible)</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Preserves only basic trace information. Select this option to minimize
the amount of space taken up by the trace output.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Advanced</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Preserves more specific trace information. Select this option to see detailed
trace information for use in troubleshooting and problem determination.</dd>
<dt>
<strong>Log Analyzer</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Preserves trace information in a format that is compatible with the Log
Analyzer tool. Select this option if you want to use the trace output as input
to the Log Analyzer tool.</dd>
</dl>
</p>

</dd>
<dt>
<strong><a name="trace_runtime_tab"></a>Runtime tab </strong>
            &nbsp;
            </dt>
<dd>Specifies the format of the trace output.
<dl>
<dt>
<strong>Save Trace</strong>
</dt>
<dd>Save changes made on the runtime tab to the trace configuration as well.
 <p>Select this box to copy run-time trace changes to the trace configuration
settings as well. Saving these changes to the trace configuration will cause
the changes to persist even if the application is restarted. </p>

</p>
<p>where
&lt;component&gt; is the component for which to enable or disable tracing, and
&lt;trace_type&gt; is the type of tracing to enable or disable. Separate multiple
tracing specifications with colons (:).</p>
<p>Components correspond to Java
packages and classes, or to collections of Java packages. Use * as a wildcard
